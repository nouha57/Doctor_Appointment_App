## Introduction :

This is an academic project that is made by a group of 6 people.

I was in charge of the Frontend Part of this application 

We chose to do a doctor appointment platform because here in Tunisia we lack platforms of this, 

Why waste time and go to the cabinet while you can take an appointment without having to leave your couch ?

We also thought of people with special conditions ( disabilities, old people ) ... this platform makes their lives much easier 

also due to COVID 19 lots of people find it hard and risky to go to the cabinet to take an appointment

See description_project.pdf for more details 

This application has 2 types of users : Doctors and Clients and each one of them has different functionalities within the app


## Technologies used :

We used mainly PHP and Laravel 



## The different parts of this application :

Frontend : 

Patient can filter the available doctors on a particular date - book a specific time for a particular date - can update his profile 

The patient dashboard also shows whether he has visited to doctor or not. If yes, he will see the medicine prescribed by the doctor on his dashboard.

Admin can create and update the doctor's information - filter the patients and see who has booked an appointment on a particular date - create departments and update and delete them - get the information about the system on his dashboard.


Doctor can create an appointment time for a particular date - can update the time slot as well.
